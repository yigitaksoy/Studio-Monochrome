### Testing User Stories from UX Design Section

#### First Time Visitor Goals

* I want to understand the main purpose of the website.
    - Upon visiting the website, users are greeted with a short video loop of a photoshoot as landing page background, along with an animated jumbotron text showing the studio name, and a subtext describing the website's purpose. 
* I want to easily navigate through the website. 
    - Upon visiting the website a call-to-action button is presented for users to easily start browsing the website. On the top right hand side there is a sticky, animated overlay navigation toggler that helps the user to navigate to any page they wish anytime they need. On the contact page there is an another call-to-action button that leads user back to the home page. 

#### Returning Visitor Goals

* I want to see the studio's portfolio. 
    - Right underneath the studio's about page, a portfolio section is presented to the user. Portfolio section contains all the photos that are taken by the studio, which are slided in with a smooth transition animation as they scroll through the section. Every image gives a detail about what type of photography studio produces. 
* I want to find out more information about the studio, and their background. 
    - Upon visiting the website, right beneath the main text on the landing page, there is a call-to-action button that leads the user directly to Studio's about page, which gives an overview of the studio's mission, informing the visitor about their background, and all the campaigns they previously worked on. 

#### Frequent User Goals

* I want to see the studio's social media presence. 
    - Studio's social media presence is presented right underneath the navigation links every time user clicks on the navbar. 
* I want to find out how to contact the studio for project requests. 
    - On the navigation bar a contact link is presented, which takes the user directly to the contact section, which is at the bottom of the website, and provides users with a contact form, along with the details of the studio.

### Debugging

- During the earlier development stages of this website, a smooth-scroll library was implemented to add smooth-scrolling effects throughout the website, and to add a horizontal scrolling section for the portfolio images. After further testing I found out that smooth-scrolling library was hijacking the native scrolling on mobile devices, therefore resulting a slower, and poor UX for the users. The issue was fixable, but in order to fix this issue there had to be changes made in the javascript. Due to its complexity, and the library being out of the scope of this project, smooth-scrolling library was removed, and implementation was left out. 

- During the testing stages of the website, contact form was causing issues, and wasn't submitting the form correctly, resulting an Authentication failure, and rejecting login attempt. After further testing issue turned out to be caused by Outlook email service. Issue was fixed by creating a new email account using Google's Gmail service. 

- During the final development stages of the website, I wanted to take a diferent approach for animating image, and text reveal effects, which were based on user's scroll direction. The code for these animations were taken from [Greensock Demos](https://codepen.io/GreenSock/pen/pojzxwZ). After further testing i've realized that the code wasn't working properly on mobile devices, therefore causing a glitch during scroll. I wasn't sure if the issue was related to my code, and i wanted to further test the issue by checking the [GSAP's official website](https://greensock.com/gsap/) with my mobile device, which uses the same animations in the demo. I found out that the same problem appears on developers website as well. I've raised this issue on the [Greensock Community Forums](https://greensock.com/forums/topic/27807-reveal-animations-based-on-scroll-direction-scrolltrigger/?tab=comments#comment-136957), and issue turned out to be a bug caused by the transition effects that were being used in the CSS, which only appears on Mobile browsers, and wasn't detected by the author. After raising the issue, developer updated their official Codepen demo, but the issue didn't seem to be fixed. Due to this reason, I've decided to update my code back to its original state, and changed my reveal animations to only work from one scroll direction, which works without issues on Desktop, and mobile devices. For more information on how to use Greensock Animations on your website, please visit [Greensock](https://greensock.com).
